- **NOTE**: Beginning fork of [overhangio/openedx-scorm-xblock](https://github.com/overhangio/openedx-scorm-xblock/tree/v18.0.2)
- [Feature] Allows author to specify an existing s3 path to serve scorm files from instead of uploading the package each time (by @geoff-va)
- [Feature] Adds `ScormState` and `ScormInteraction` models to track some basic analytics for aggregation and reporting (by @geoff-va)
  - `ScormInteraction` is not currently enabled but the implementation is there
- [Bugfix] Removes `renderjson.js` from studio authorview as it was causing unit navigation to randomly fail
  - This script is used to pretty-print scorm user state for admin's
  - The user search endpoint returns a 403 if `runtime.user_is_staff` is `False`, but that property does not appear to exist in the studio runtime environment (Olive) so would never work anyway
